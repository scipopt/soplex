Next - Release 8.0.0
==================

build system:

- For cmake >= 3.30 CMP0167 is enforced and BOOST_ROOT no longer supported, please use Boost_DIR instead with these cmake versions.
- increased minimal required cmake version to 3.11
- revised SANITIZE options for makefile: removed SANITIZE=full, added SANITIZE=thread, SANITIZE=address, and SANITIZE=memory to enable
  thread, address, and memory sanitizers, respectively, in addition to undefined behavior sanitizer;
  changed default to SANITIZE=false
- replaced `SANITIZE_XYZ=(on|off)` options for cmake by `SANITIZE=(on|off|thread|address|memory)` and let it have an actual effect on the build;
  undefined behavior sanitizer is always enabled if not `SANITIZE=off` (the default)
- Makefiles: By default, SoPlex links with MPFR=true and GMP=true if and only if BOOST=true (options GMP=auto and MPFR=auto)
- Makefiles: Change default value of BOOST to false; set BOOST=true manually to obtain exact rational solving functionality
- cmake: if SoPlex is build with MPFR, then also projects that use such a SoPlex installation will now look for MPFR

- add option to print primal/dual solutions to a file using `-x=<filename>` or `-y=<filename>`, respectively
  exact rational solutions can be written with `-X=<filename>` or `-Y=<filename>`. If `<filename>` is the
  same for multiple options the different solutions are appended to the same file
- new option to use incremental precision boosting for rational LP solving. If MPFR is linked (requirement for boosting)
  the new default configuration is precision boosting an outer iterative refinement loop. Can be changed with `bool:precision_boosting`

interface & parameters:
- allow reading of files with arbitrarily long lines by reallocating buffers dynamically
- add new functions to soplex_interface.cpp: SoPlex_readInstanceFile(), SoPlex_readBasisFile(),
  SoPlex_readSettingsFile(), SoPlex_setBoolParam(), SoPlex_setRealParam(), SoPlex_removeColReal(),
  SoPlex_removeRowReal(), SoPlex_getRedCostReal(), SoPlex_getStatus(), SoPlex_getSolvingTime(),
  SoPlex_getNumIterations(), SoPlex_changeRowLhsReal(), SoPlex_changeRowRhsReal(), SoPlex_changeRangeReal(),

  `int:decomp_maxaddedrows`, `int:decomp_verbosity`
- added parameters related to exact solving and precision boosting:
  `bool:adapt_tols_to_multiprecision` -> should tolerances be scaled down when precision is increased
  `bool:boosted_warm_start` -> should high-precision solve start from advanced basis
  `bool:iterative_refinement` -> should iterative refinement be used
  `bool:precision_boosting` -> should precision boosting be used
  `bool:recovery_mechanism` -> should the old recovery mechanism be used when iterative refinement fails
  `int:multiprecision_limit` -> maximal precision in decimal digits
  `int:storeBasisSimplexFreq` -> frequency to store basis in high precision solve
  `real:precision_boosting_factor` -> factor by which precision is increased in each boosting iteration
- changed minimum values for parameters `real:fpfeastol` and `real:fpopttol` from 1e-12 to 0
- new parameters to enable/disable individual presolving techniques:
  `bool:simplifier_enable_domcol`, `bool:simplifier_enable_dualfix`, `bool:simplifier_enable_fixcontinuous`,
  `bool:simplifier_enable_parallelcols`, `bool:simplifier_enable_parallelrows`, `bool:simplifier_enable_propagation`,
  `bool:simplifier_enable_singletoncols`, `bool:simplifier_enable_stuffing`

performance:

code quality:

- rework the way tolerances are handled in SoPlex and remove many hard-coded parameters:
  there now exists a shared_ptr<Tolerances> in soplex.h that is handed down to all the sub-classes
  this is especially necessary for higher-precision solves with precision-boosting
- rewrite all preprocessor-defines to be unambiguous by prepending a `SPX`, e.g., `MSG_ERROR` is now `SPX_MSG_ERROR`.
- rework soplex debug messages to use SFINAE, since they no longer worked properly after switching to header-only
- add .lp instances to ctest
- remove unmaintained legacy code for decomposition based dual simplex

fixed bugs:
- fix unset tolerances for simplifier and ratio tester plugins in soplex' copy constructor
- fix unset outstream pointer in soplex' copy constructor

- fix bugs in LP file reader, concerning rational numbers as well as dynamic line length
- fix bug printing solutions and statistics when running from the command line
- fix bug in cmake build system when MPFR is available but boost is not

=============================

features:

performance:

fixed bugs:
- reoptimize without preprocessing and scaling if SoPlex terminates with ABORT_VALUE,
  but objective value does not exceed the limit for the original problem
- make sure fast presolvers are finished before starting dual presolving

  if polishing affected the objective value
- make sure fast presolvers are finished before starting dual presolving

miscellaneous:


December 2022 Release 6.0.3
=============================

miscellaneous:
- changed license to Apache 2.0, see https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.

October 2022 - Release 6.0.2
=============================

- version bump

June 2022 - Release 6.0.1
=============================

fixed bugs:
- fix bug in varStatusToBasisStatusCol when setting Basis for implicitly free variables

January 2022 - Release 6.0.0
=============================

features:
- integrated PaPILO as new simplifier option
- improved the buildsystem by adding a cmake-configurable `config.h.in` header in the same fashion
  as it is handled in SCIP
- replaced SoPlex internal `Rational` class by the boost multiprecision library for rational numbers;
  this enables the possibility of performing a rational LP solve, even without linking GMP
- restored classic command line interface to remove dependency on the Boost program options library
- changed the command-line argument for running soplex with higher precision;
  formerly the multiprecision mode was triggered by setting `solvemode=3` (multiprecision),
  or `solvemode=4` (quadprecision); Now higher precision arithmetic has its own
  argument `arithmetic` (0 - double, 1 - quadprecision, 2 - multiprecision);
  This makes it possible to also use rational solving mode in combination with multiprecision

interface & parameters:
- added interrupt flag to optimize() (default NULL)
- added new simplifier enum SIMPLIFIER_PAPILO and SIMPLFIER_INTERNAL (replacing the deprecated SIMPLIFIER_AUTO)

performance:

code quality:
- fixed deprecated copy compiler warnings that occur with newer compilers
- added a ClassSet<T> class that functions in the same way as DataSet<T> for types that are not data-types

fixed bugs:

December 2020 - Release 5.0.2
===============================

performance:
- stricter limitation of refinement rounds with failed or slow progress in accuracy

fixed bugs:

- fix comparison in postsolving of row singleton simplifier
- fixed overly conservative assert in postsolving of row objective simplifier
- always clear rational LU factorization when changing the problem to avoid inconsistent basis data
- ensure consistent basis data when floating-point solves fail during iterative refinement
- fixed bug regarding objective sense when starting SYNCMODE_MANUAL
- handle infinity values in IdxCompare of pricers
- fixed incorrect assert in devex and steepest edge pricer

- iterative refinement: fixed possible infinite loop and consistency issue

30 March 2020 - Release 5.0.0
=============================

interface & parameters:
- show number of violations in log to improve understanding of solving progress
- new parameter 'int:printbasismetric' to replace 'int:printcondition'
  (-1: off, 0: condition estimate, 1: trace, 2: determinant, 3: condition)
- new parameter 'real:min_markowitz' to limit the Markowitz stability threshold
  (range 0.0001 to 0.9999, high values sacrifice performance for stability)
- new parameter 'int:stattimer' to control time measurement for statistics during solving
  (0: off, 1: user time, 2: wallclock time)
- new parameter 'bool:forcebasic', determines whether optimal solution has to be basic when performing
  rational solve with iterative refinement, triggers rational factorization if reconstruction optimal
  but not basic
- SoPlex can now do a multiprecision solve, i.e., `SoPlex<R>` with `R =
  boost::multiprecision::number<T>` will work. In particular, for Linux and Mac,
  SoPlex can do a multiprecision solve with `mpfr_float` and on windows with
  `cpp_float`.
- extended parameter 'solvemode' with value (3 - multiprecision solve, 4 - solve with Quadruple precision (128bit))
- new parameter 'precision' (only active in solvemode 3) to set the precision
- Templated SoPlex, SPxSolver, and SPxBasis.
- Renamed SoPlex<R>, SPxSolver<R>, and SPxBasis<R> to SoPlexBase<R>,
  SPxSolverBase<R>, SPxBasisBase<R> respectively for backwards compatibility
  (and for SCIP.)
- Following renames:
  | From                   | To                    |
  |------------------------|-----------------------|
  | `getDualFarkas`        | `getDualFarkasSol`    |
  | `getDualFarkasT`       | `getDualFarkas`       |
  | `getBoundViolationT`   | `getBoundViolation`   |
  | `numColsT`             | `numCols`             |
  | `numRowsT`             | `numRows`             |
  | `getRedCost`           | `getRedCostSol`       |
  | `getRedCostT`          | `getRedCost`          |
  | `writeFile`            | `writeFileLPBase`     |
  | `writeFileT`           | `writeFile`           |
  | `getRowViolationT`     | `getRowViolation`     |
  | `getDualViolationT`    | `getDualViolation`    |
  | `getRedCostViolationT` | `getRedCostViolation` |
  | `getDual`              | `getDualSol`          |
  | `getDualT`             | `getDual`             |
  | `getPrimal`            | `getPrimalSol`        |
  | `getPrimalT`           | `getPrimal`           |
  | `numNonZerosT`         | `numNonZeros`         |
  | `_optimizeT`           | `_optimize`           |
  | `getPrimalRay`         | `getPrimalRaySol`     |
  | `getPrimalRayT`        | `getPrimalRay`        |

- Wrapped the following functions:
  1. `getDualFarkasReal`
  2. `numColsReal`
  3. `getRedCostReal`
  4. `getDualReal`
  5. `getPrimalReal`

- Renamed `SPxSolverBase<R>::getDualfarkas` to `SPxSolverBase<R>::getDualFarkas`
  (for consistency.) Note that there is a method with the same name in `SoPlexBase<R>`.
- Rewrote the code for command line argument parsing. Current code uses Boost Program Options.
   Note that you do not need Program Options if you just want to build the SoPlex library.
- Some of the memory allocation from heap (using spx_alloc) changed to static memory.
- Improvements in exception handling in `src/soplexmain.cpp`
- Renamed `int numNonzeros` to `nNonzeros`
- Moved definitions of generic functions from a `.cpp` file to corresponding
  `.hpp` file
- New features for Rational class:
  1. Constructor from `boost::multiprecision::number<T>`.
  2. Conversion from Rational to `boost::multiprecision::number<T>`, provided
     that boost can handle `mpq_t` to `T` conversion.
- Changes to `VectorBase<T>` and `DVectorBase<T>`:
  1. `VectorBase<T>` is now a wrapper of `std::vector<T>`, it no longer uses
      pre-allocated memory.
  2. The class can handle the additional functionality `DVectorBase<T>`, e.g.,
     `memSize()`, `reSize()`, `scaleAssign(,,).`
  3. internal member `int dimen` *removed*. `val.size()` or `VectorBase<R>::dim()`
     is a replacement.
  4. Replaced calls to memcpy and memmove with `std::copy().` Former functions
     are not compatible with Types that are not trivially copyable.
  5. Defined move constructor and move assignment.
  6. Added begin() and end() iterators that return the corresponding iterator of
     the internal std::vector.
  7. Added vec() function that returns a const reference to the underlying vector.
  8. *Reason for changes*: VectorBase previously used to manage a pointer and
     DVectorBase managed memory allocation by doing malloc, realloc and free
     calls. But this is only guaranteed to work with trivially copyable data types,
     the new g++ compilers were already issuing warnings about this for some time.
     The multiprecision vectors were not working. The same is also true for changes
     inside CLUFactor classes.
  8. *Removed* `isConsistent()`, which used to check a vector was empty and had no
     memory allocated at the same time. This never happens with the std::vector
     wrapper, hence the removal.
  9. *Removed* DVectorBase. Replaced by VectorBase. The alias DVector is replaced by
     the alias Vector. (This has the same problem as VectorBase<T>)
- DataArray now checks if template type is trivially copyable via `static_assert`.
  Changed all instances of DataArray where this is not the case to Array.
- Changed Array to wrap std::vector to be more efficient and easier to use.
- Changed spxmainsm to use smart pointers inside of Array
- The following internal objects of the CLUFactor class was changed from a raw
  pointer to a std::vector
  1. `u.col.val`, `u.row.val`
  2. `l.val`, `l.rval`
  3. `diag`
  4. `s_max`
- Replaced several instances of "`spx_alloc` an object, then `spx_realloc` the
  object" with using `std::vector`. Because `realloc` is not guaranteed to work
  on objects with non-trivial copy constructors, in particular, with
  `boost::multiprecision::number.`

============================

features:

  - enabled by default
- decomposition based dual simplex:
  - an experimental version of the a decomposition based approach to avoid degeneracy in the dual simplex method
  - activated by setting the parameter bool:decompositiondualsimplex to true.
    - this sets the basis representation to 'row', the solve mode to 'real', and the algorithm to 'dual'.
  - additional parameters include:
    usecompdual: setting to true using the dual formulation of the complementary problem, default is false.
    explicitviol: setting to true explicitly computes the violation of the reduced problem solution instead of using the
      complementary problem to identify violated rows, default is false.
    decomp_iterlimit: the number of algorithm iterations for the decomposition based simplex.
    decomp_maxaddedrows: the maximum number of rows added to the reduced problem in each algorithm iteration.
    decomp_displayfreq: the frequency of output for the decomposition based simplex.
    decomp_verbosity: the verbosity level of the decomposition based simplex.
- computing the degeneracy of a basis in each iteration:
  - the parameter computedegen, when set to true will compute the degeneracy of each basis.
- write dual formulation to file: additional command line option "--writedual" is provided to write the dual formulation
  to a file. When providing this option only the file is output, the problem is not solved.
- new condition number estimate based on the quotient of max and min diagonal element of LU factorization

performance:

- persistent scaling can be disabled by setting bool:persistentscaling to 0
- new bool parameter 'fullperturbation' to perturb the entire problem instead of only the bounds relevant
  for the current pivot
- new bool parameter 'isOptimal' for unsimplify() to disable some debug checks that are only valid for optimal solutions

  parallel handling of rational and floating-point versions of LP and solution data
- improved iterative refinement algorithm, handling also unbounded and infeasible LPs

- new SPxSolver status INForUNBD
- own objective sense enumerator in MPS parser

- implemented bound flipping ratio test for row representation
- simplifier keeps relevant bounds if bound flipping ratio test is used
- new method to calculate the condition number of the current basis matrix (2-norm, estimate)
- new auto pricing switching from devex to steep after a set number of iterations

- allow instable enter pivot when no other is available; only after a fresh factorization
- ensure that problem is not perturbed when concluding optimality
- fixed numerical bug in unsimplification of doubleton equations
- (co)solve calls in SPxBasis do not trigger factorization() of SPxSolver but of SPxBasis

fixed bugs:
- fixed inconsistent generic column and row names

- fixed inconsistency in "Fast" ratiotester when "short" leave is possible
- fixed bugs in unsimplification of zero objective singleton columns and row singletons
- relaxed wrong assert in SPxSolver::unShift()

31 Jul 2012 - Release 1.7.0
===========================

code quality & new features:
- partial pricing can be switched on for dantzig-, devex- and steep-pricing by defining PARTIAL_PRICING (only LEAVING mode)
- current basis matrix can be written to a file in MatrixMarket format using SPxBasis::printMatrixMTX
- exact initialization of steepest edge weights possible by calling setupWeights of SPxSteepPR
- option -bw writes the basis of the original problem to a file; works now with simplifier as well
- allowed primal and dual feasibility tolerance to be set independently in simplifier and simplex routines
- added GMP support and data type MpqReal, a wrapper for mpq_class if compiled with GMP=true, soplex::Real otherwise
- implemented iterative refinement for feasible and bounded LPs, applied when a feasibility or optimality tolerance below
  the new parameter SPxSolver::irthreshold() is requested
- reduced and commented code by adding "void deleteVec(DLPSV* ps);" method in svset.{h,cpp}

fixed bugs:
- variables that do not appear in the objective function or any constraint are not printed anymore in the BOUNDS section
  of the mps file
- allow instable leave iterations, i.e., leave iterations with pivot element below default stability threshold, only
  after a fresh factorization
- check redundant variable bounds implied by rows more carefully: do not apply if max/min activity exceeds sides by a
  factor greater than 1.0/epsilon to avoid roundoff errors
- initialize basis descriptor to statuses D_UNDEFINED in order to avoid access of uninitialized values at time out
- fixed bug in stalling detection: SoPlex incorrectly assumed that pricing had been finished and hence claimed optimality
- handled setting FIXED basis status when bounds are only approximately equal
- using a starting basis from file disables simplifier
- fixed bug in computeLeaveCoPrhs4Col() for column status D_UNDEFINED
- fixed bug in unsimplifying singleton rows
- fixed cycling caused by refactorization after pricer finds no more candidates
- fixed bug that bound changes were not performed if new bound deviates by only epsilon; this can lead to slightly
  inconsistent bounds which trigger asserts later
- sparse pricing stores only infeasibilities > entertol() in leaving or > leavetol() in entering (was epsilon() before)
- fixed false infeasibility detection in ratiotest after fresh factorization
- fixed bug in the svset data array, when removing the first vector, the memory was not 'freed' and therefore the memory
  consumption could have increased to a very huge value (bug 319)
- also fixed wrong ensureMem() call in SVSet create(), which lead to a to big data array and change an unnecessary
  insert() call to an reSize() call
- corrected a memcpy() to a memmove() call due to possible overlapping memory
- fixed bug in counting unsuccessful pivots

interface:
- info message in case a fresh factorization is not stable enough and has to be done again with higher Markowitz threshold
- new command line option -p6 to use steepest edge pricer with exact initialization
- verb levels v4 and higher display current pricing mode (sparse or conventional)
- additional simplify() method with independent primal and dual feasibility tolerance as parameters
- new exception SPxInterfaceException to be thrown if inconsistent parameters are passed to interface methods
- new methods feastol(), opttol(), setFeastol(), setOpttol() in classes SoPlex and SPxSolver to get/set primal and dual
  feasibility tolerance; delta() and setDelta() still exist and work as before
- new command line options -f and -o to set primal feasibility and optimality tolerance, respectively; -d still exists and
  works as before
- exact steepest edge is the new default pricing strategy and is implemented as separate class (inherited from SPxSteepPR)
- correct dual statuses when loading a basis with SPxBasis::loadDesc(); they might have become inconsistent when bounds
  or sides had been changed
- new methods SPxLP::computePrimalActivity() and SPxLP::computeDualActivity() for given primal and dual solution vectors
  using exact arithmetic
- new methods irthreshold() and setIrthreshold() for threshold parameter below which iterative refinement is applied

performance:
- sparse pricing for leaving and entering simplex is activated depending on ratio of basis dimension and number of infeasibilities
- fixed performance issue removing (all) vectors from a SVSet where it is better to delete the elements from behind to
  the front


28 Oct 2011 - Release 1.6.0
===========================

code quality & new features:
- time for basis updates can now be measured by defining flag MEASUREUPDATETIME in spxbasis.h (off by default)
- removed "-static" option from Makefile due to linking troubles on newer systems without static libraries; can still be
  added using the make option "USRLDFLAGS=-static"
- added -fp:precise and -Oi to make.mingw.x86.{cl,intel}.opt
- added define SOPLEX_SUBVERSION to track internal development version (src/spxdefines.h)
- added SHARED variable in Makefile for creating shared libraries and binaries
- added functionality to solve systems with three right hand sides
- added partial quicksort to sorter.h
- increased priority of debugging output
- added "install" target to Makefile; this target can be used to install SoPlex into certain directory on the system
  (works for Linux and Mac); for this, you have to specify INSTALLDIR (make install INSTALLDIR=/urs/local/)
- removed compiler flag NO_ADDITIONAL_CHECKS in code and makefile options: now, additional checks are only performed
  when ENABLE_ADDITIONAL_CHECKS or ENABLE_CONSISTENCY_CHECKS is explicitly defined (globally or in a specific file)
- githash of current commit is displayed (also in check mode)

interface:
- LP reader: print warning when encountering a floating point number with empty exponent (hints at variable name with
  initial 'e' or 'E')
- methods selectEnter() and selectLeave() in ratio testers now receive index/id of leaving/entering variable as input
  parameter
- added methods to solve the linear systems of equations for 3 right hand sides simultaneously
- added method getPrimalray() to classes SoPlex and SPxSolver for primal unbounded LPs
- added command line option '-L' to set iteration limit
- allowed free basis status (SPxSolver::ZERO, SPxBasis::Desc::P_FREE) for variables and constraints with finite bounds
- adapted method to read/write basis for free nonbasic variables
- added command line option '-t3' to use the bound flipping ratio test (long step dual)
- number of performed bound flips during ratio test are displayed as 'flips=' in line 'Finished solving...'
- added method to clear starting basis in class SoPlex (SoPlex::clearBasis())

performance:
- increased default Markowitz threshold to 0.04 to increase numerical stability of the factorization
- implemented bound flipping ratio test ("long step dual") for column representation

fixed bugs:
- added missing -m64 in LDFLAGS of make.{darwin,sunos}.x86_64.gnu.* and make.{linux,freebsd}.x86_64.gnu.opt*
- added missing -DNDEBUG in make.mingw.x86.{cl,intel}.opt
- fixed incorrect access to member variables in constructors of class DataHashTable
- fixed bug in SPxFastRT: also in the first phase consider only nonbasic entering variables in COLUMN/LEAVING mode
- fixed bug in COLUMN/ENTERING algorithm yielding incorrect detection of unboundedness or inverted primal ray: when
  deciding whether a free variable entering the basis should increase or decrease from zero, we have to look at the
  reduced cost, not the objective function
- fixed too early check of iteration limit (now not checked in SPxSolver::terminate() anymore, but at beginning of each
  iteration)
- fixed bug in unsimplifcation of duplicate rows presolving
- fixed bug when setting basis through class SoPlex
- fixed bug occuring with large column/row bounds: if we refactorize, we also have to recompute the right hand side of
  Bx=b, because roundoff errors might have occured during its update
- fixed segmentation fault in simplifier when postsolving is interrupted with an exception
- fixed wrong error output in statistics when an instance is solved during presolve
- pricer SPxDevex now performs one additional pivot if only slightly feasible/optimal; this helps to prevent suboptimal
  results on some unsimplified instances
- fixed potential NULL pointer dereference in nameset.h, when name is not found in hashtable
- fixed potential segmentation fault when calling sorting routines on empty arrays (sorter.h)
- send debugging output to standard out instead of error stream
- fixed bug in unsimplification of duplicate columns (do not replace two linearly dependent columns by one if free basis
  status can not be resolved in unsimplification)
- fixed several bugs when unsimplifying infeasible bases
- fixed counting of removed rows during simplifier


30 Sep 2010 - Release 1.5.0
===========================

code quality & new features:
- changed memory handling in class DataKey: replacing bitfield implementation by two int's
- improved handling of singular bases and cycling: automatically restart from initial basis with tighter tolerances
- major rework of simplifier SPxMainSM: "localized" postsolving steps; several bugfixes concerning basis statuses, dual
  values and reduced costs
- performance improved in simplifier SPxMainSM: always processing singleton rows before finding duplicate rows; ignoring
  singleton rows and columns when checking for linear dependency

interface:
- submakefile for FreeBSD added
- added command line option '-y' to output dual row multipliers
- additional interface method SoPlex::setBasis to set starting basis if no simplifer present

fixed bugs:
- bug in class SoPlex appearing when LP is solved completely in simplifier and optimal solution retrieved
- bug in spxbasis.cpp: when basis is detected as singular during update step, now we refactorize to double check; if the
  singularity is not resolved we exit with correct status
- bug in simplifier postsolving: empty columns may not only be fixed to bounds but also to zero for free variable
- bug in SPxSolver::setPricer() appearing when switching pricers in initialized state
- bug in simplifier SPxMainSM yielding incorrect dual values and reduced costs for maximization problems
- bug in simplifier SPxMainSM for postsolving of free columns with zero objective
- bug in factorization triggered by column singletons with nonzeros below numerical zero tolerance


11 Sep 2009 - Release 1.4.2
===========================

code quality & new features:
- in class SoPlex, enabled getBasis... methods also when simplifier is present and basis suboptimal, but regular
- added check for stalling in main solve loop SPxSolver::solve(): if objective value and shift haven't changed after a
  large number of iterations, switch algorithm; this fixes a timeout of SCIP/SoPlex on instance glass4 (MIPLIB2003)

interface:
- small change in spxmpswrite.cpp: always write the default upper bound of 1.0 for integer variables, since CPLEX seems
  to set infinity otherwise
- added method 'std::string statistics() const' to classes SoPlex, SPxSolver, SPxBasis, SLinSolver, SLUFactor, returning
  statistical information like number of factorizations etc.
- added method 'Real cumulativeTime() const' to class SPxSolver returning time used in all calls to method solve() since
  beginning or last call of 'resetCumulativeTime()'
- implemented copy constructors and assignment operators for almost all classes, especially SoPlex and SPxSolver
- the set methods (for pricer, ratiotester, ...) in classes SoPlex and SPxSolver now have an optional boolean parameter
  (false by default) controlling whether the memory of the object handed over shall be managed internally; this does not
  affect the default behaviour of the interface methods
- the constructor of class SPxSolver does not have parameters for pricer, ratiotester and starter, anymore; use the set
  methods instead

fixed bugs:
- now correctly resetting basis status to REGULAR in method SPxSolver::loadBasis()
- memory bug in function memPack() in svset.cpp; this method is now called to clean up memory, in case too much memory
  is wasted; this removes a large increase of the use of memory as tested in tests/testMemory.cpp
- bug in formulas for triggering refactorizations after increased relative/absolute fill
- memory leak in class SPxMainSM when calling simplify() multiple times
- bug in class DataKey leading to a segmentation fault when reading LPs with more than 8,388,607 variables or
  constraints: now the maximum number allowed is 536,870,911 and asserted in debug mode
- numerical bug in SPxFastRT leading to failed assert 'rep() == ROW' (in leave.cpp): in column/leaving algorithm, now we
  only consider nonbasic variables for entering the basis


20 Feb 2009 - Release 1.4.1
===========================

code quality & new features:
- speed up of the simplifier due to combined removal of rows/columns and combined updates of lhs and rhs in some cases
- overworked spxfastrt.h, spxfastrt.cpp
- added method isDescValid() in class SPxBasis to check if a descriptor is valid w.r.t. to the bounds of the loaded LP;
  use this to check whether previous/given basis can be loaded in SoPlex::solve()

interface:
- small changes in spxlpfwrite.cpp: make bounds LP-format conform, output 'generals' only if integer variables present
- added new method writeState() to classes SoPlex and SPxSolver for dumping LP, basis, and parameter settings at once

fixed bugs:
- bug in simplifier spxmainsm.cpp: wrong init for postsolving free column singletons fixed
- wrong bugfix in spxsolver.cpp:maxInfeas(): the leave and entering case were switched back
- endless loop triggered by different values of feasibility/optimality tolerance for pricer in spxsolve.cpp
- memory handling in class UnitVector
- bug when resolving in SoPlex::solve() after change of LP


30 Sep 2008 - Release 1.4.0
===========================

code quality & new features:
- split the main() method in example.cpp into several smaller methods
- created directory 'tests' that should contain small programs that illustrate a (former) bug in SoPlex or something
  like unit tests
- added member function precision() in spxout.h
- changed main target to soplexmain (from example)
- soplexmain.cpp now contains the main function, the output of this function should be more readable than the one of
  example; original output can be turned on with the "-C" command line argument, the example is now available as target
  'example' in the makefile
- name unification:
  + moved SPxLP::readFile() from spxfileio.cpp to spxio.cpp
  + renamed SPxLP::dumpFile() to SPxLP::writeFile(), included default params, moved it from spxlpfwrite.cpp to spxio.cpp
- simplified postsolving in spxmainsm.cpp (do not recompute reduced costs)
- overworked spxbasis.cpp:readBasis(): fixed bug and removed superflous code at end
- added fixing of the basis status if ZERO/P_FREE is not appropriate anymore, see varStatusToBasisStatusCol() and
  varStatusToBasisStatusRow() in spxsolver.cpp
- removed superfluous variable 'count' in spxparmultpr.cpp/h
- modifications in the simplifier SPxMainSM to avoid numerical problems
- modified reading and writing of basis: the row and column names are now passed as pointers; default names are
  entered if the pointers are 0; the changes appear in soplexmain.cpp, spxbasis.cpp, soplex.cpp, soplex.h

interface:
- introduced exceptions for all unrecoverable errors (lack of memory, no pricer, singular basis, etc.) to allow a
  calling application to clean up
- command line options "-V" and "-h" of example solver now output info on compilation flags
- replaced SPxLP::operator<< by SPxLP::writeLPF()
- implemented basic handling of reading a basis file (not yet thoroughly tested); the basic changes are in example.cpp,
  spxbasis.cpp, soplex.cpp, soplex.h
- added option to produce shared libraries with x86-Linux (OPT=opt-shared)
- constructor interface for the scalers SPxEquiliSC and SPxGeometSC changed: parameter colFirst is removed since the
  corresponding member is not used; printed names of the scalars are slightly changed; there are only 5 command line
  options for the scalar left since two of the previous 6 options coincided

fixed bugs:
- two bugs in spxlpfread.cpp: variables appearing in the bounds and general/integer/binary section
- bug in changeElement(): it now works also in the initial phase (NO_PROBLEM); aA corresponding test file is
  'tests/testChangeElement.cpp'
- bug in forest.cpp: use proper array access instead of pointer iteration
- bug concerning the termination value (objective limit) in spxsolve.cpp
- memory leak in postsolving of spxmainsm.cpp
- bug in spxchangebasis.cpp, addedRows(), addedCols(): need to call loadMatrixVecs in all cases, since the references to
  the matrix might have been invalided due to reallocation
- bug with detecting infeasible instances if scaling theCoTest does not help
- bug in spxlpfread.cpp with bounds on binary (old bounds were discarded)
- bug in spxsolver.cpp:maxInfeas(): the leave and entering case were switched
- bug in SLUFactor::solveRight4update(): now variable n is storing ssvec's size correctly
- bug in leave.cpp, left over from previous correction dealing with infeasible instances

===========================

code quality & new features:
- made writeBasis() and writeBasisFile() in SoPlex and SPxSolver const-methods
- added SPxLP::writeLPF() with some parameters to dump an LP in .lp-format with variable and row names; this also fixes
  some output bugs; the still existing SPxLP::operator<< uses self-created default names

interface:
- restructured example.cpp and added a small example on constructing an LP using the callable library methods

fixed bugs:
- bug in spxmainsm: IDs of rows and columns are not used anymore

- bug in soplex method unsimplify(): check whether problem vanished in preprocessing added
- bug in spxlpfreader in connection with strange input (unconstrained rows)

- new preprocessing
- the number of warnings issued for ignored entries in MPS files is now limited to 1000 per file
