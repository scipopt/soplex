/**@mainpage Overview
 *
 * @section MAIN What is SoPlex?
 *
 * SoPlex is an optimization package for solving linear programming problems
 * (LPs) that can be used standalone via a command line interface and as a
 * callable library.  Its main features are:
 *
 * - an advanced implementation of the primal and dual revised simplex
 *   algorithm,
 *
 * - an object-oriented software design written in C++,
 *
 * - presolving, scaling, exploitation of sparsity, hot-starting from any
 *   regular basis,
 *
 * - column- and row-oriented form of the simplex algorithm,
 *
 * - a compile-time option to use 80bit extended ("quad") precision for
 *   numerically difficult LPs, and
 *
 * - special support for the exact solution of LPs over the rational numbers.
 *
 * SoPlex has been used in numerous research and industry projects and is the
 * standard LP solver linked to the constraint integer programming solver <a
 * href="http://scipopt.org/">SCIP</a>.

/**@page DataObjects Data Objects

    \em Data \em objects refer to C++ objects that do not allocate any
    resources, particularly that do not allocate any memory.  This
    makes them behave just like ordinary C structures, in that both,
    the copy constructor and assignment operator are equivalent to a
    memcopy of the memory taken by the object. Examples for data
    objects are all builtin types such as \c int or \c double or
    \e simple classes such as \c complex.

    We distinguish \em data \em objects from general C++ objects that
    may include some allocation of resources. (Note that for general
    C++ objects that do allocate resources, this must be respected by
    providing appropriate copy constructor and assignment operators.)
    An example for a general C++ class is class DataArray.

    The distinction between data and general C++ objects becomes
    relevant when using such objects in container classes such as
    DataArray or Array.

/**@page PARS Parameters in SoPlex
 *
 * Since SoPlex 2.0, the main interface class \ref soplex::SoPlex "SoPlex" provides an improved management of

 *@section PARS1 Setting parameters at the command line
 *
 * When using the command line interface, parameters can be changed with the generic option
 *
 * <code>\-\-&lt;type&gt;:&lt;name&gt;=&lt;val&gt;</code>
 *
 * where &lt;type&gt; is one of <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, or <code>real</code> and name is the name of the

 *
 *@section PARS2 Setting parameters via the callable library
 *
 * When using the callable library via the class \ref soplex::SoPlex "SoPlex" (of version 2.0 and above), parameters can
 * be changed by the methods \ref soplex::SoPlex::setBoolParam() "setBoolParam()", \ref soplex::SoPlex::setIntParam()

 */


/**@page PROG Programming with SoPlex
 *
 * Besides the main interface class \ref soplex::SoPlex "SoPlex", the classes of
 * the SoPlex library are categorized into three different types:
 *
 * - Elementary classes are provided for general purpose use in projects way
 *   beyond the scope of numerical software or linear programming.
 *
 * - Linear algebra classes provide basic data types for (sparse) linear algebra
 *   computations. However, their functionality is restricted to simple
 *   operations such as addition and scaling.  For complex tasks, such as
 *   solving linear systems of equations, algorithmic classes are provided
 *   instead.
 *
 * - Algorithmic classes serve for implementing maybe a variety of algorithms
 *   for solving numerical (sub-)problems.
 *
 * The main class implementing the primal and dual simplex algorithm is the
 * class \ref soplex::SPxSolver "SPxSolver".  The following sections are
 * dedicated to users who want to provide own components of the simplex
 * algorithm such as pricers, ratio tests, start basis generators or LP
 * simplifiers to use with SoPlex's standard floating-point simplex
 * implementation.
 *
 *@section Representation Virtualizing the Representation
 *
 * The primal Simplex on the columnwise representation is structurally
 * equivalent to the dual Simplex on the rowwise representation and vice versa
 * (see below). Hence, it is desirable to treat both cases in a very similar
 * manner. This is supported by the programmer's interface of SoPlex which
 * provides access methods for all internal data in two ways: one is relative to
 * the "physical" representation of the LP in rows and columns, while the other
 * is relative to the chosen basis representation.
 *
 * If e.g. a \ref soplex::SPxPricer "SPxPricer" is written using the second type
 * of methods only (which will generally be the case), the same code can be used
 * for running SoPlex's simplex algorithm for both representations.  We will now
 * give two examples for this abstraction from the chosen representation.
 *
 * Methods \c vector() will return a column or a row vector, corresponding to
 * the chosen basis representation.  The other "vectors" will be referred to as
 * \em covectors:
 *
 * <TABLE>
 * <TR><TD>&nbsp;  </TD><TD>ROW      </TD><TD>COLUMN   </TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>vector  </TD><TD>rowVector</TD><TD>colVector</TD></TR>
 * <TR><TD>coVector</TD><TD>colVector</TD><TD>rowVector</TD></TR>
 * </TABLE>
 *
 * Whether the \ref soplex::SPxBasisBase::Desc::Status "SPxBasisBase::Desc::Status" of a
 * variable indicates that the corresponding vector is in the basis matrix or
 * not also depends on the chosen representation. Hence, methods \c isBasic()
 * are provided to get the correct answer for both representations.
 *
 *@section Simplex Vectors and Bounds
 *
 * The Simplex algorithms keeps three vectors which are associated to each
 * basis.  Two of them are required for the pricing, while the third one is
 * needed for detecting feasibility of the basis. For all three vectors, bounds
 * are defined. The Simplex algorithm changes the basis until all three vectors
 * satisfy their bounds, which means that the optimal solution has been found.
 *
 * With each update of the basis, also the three vectors need to be
 * updated. This is best supported by the use of \c UpdateVectors.
 *
 *@subsection Variables
 *
 * The Simplex algorithm works with two types of variables, primals and duals.
 * The primal variables are associated with each column of an LP, whereas the
 * dual variables are associated with each row.  However, for each row a slack
 * variable must be added to the set of primals (to represent inequalities), and
 * a reduced cost variable must be added for each column (to represent upper or
 * lower bounds). Note, that mathematically, one dual variable for each bound
 * (upper and lower) should be added. However, this variable would always yield
 * the same value and can, hence, be implemented as one.
 *
 * To summarize, we have a primal variable for each LP column and row (i.e., its
 * slack) as well as a dual variable for each LP row and column (i.e., its
 * bounds). However, not all these values need to be stored and computed, since
 * the structure of the Simplex algorithms allow to keep them implicitly.
 *
 * If the SPxBasis's Status of a row or column is one of \c P_ON_LOWER, \c
 * P_ON_UPPER, \c P_FIXED or \c P_FREE, the value of the corresponding primal
 * variable is the lower, upper or both bound(s) or 0, respectively.  The
 * corresponding dual variable needs to be computed. Equivalently, for a Status
 * of \c D_FREE, \c D_ON_UPPER, \c D_ON_LOWER, \c D_ON_BOTH or \c D_UNDEFINED,
 * the corresponding dual variable is 0, whereas the primal one needs to be
 * computed.
 *
 * The following vectors are declared for holding the values to be computed: \c
 * primRhs, \c primVec (with dimension \c nCols()) for the primal variables, and
 * \c dualRhs, \c dualVec (with dimension \c nRows()) for the dual
 * variables. The additional variable \c addvec (with dimension \c coDim())
 * depends on the representation.
 *
 * @subsection Bounds
 *
 * Primal and dual variables are bounded (including \f$\pm\infty\f$ as bounds).
 * If all primal variables are within their bounds, the Simplex basis is said to
 * be primal feasible. Analogously, if all dual variables are within their
 * bounds, its is called dual feasible.  If a basis is both, primal and dual
 * feasible, the optimal solution has been found.
 *
 * In the dual Simplex, the basis is maintained dual feasible, while primal
 * feasibility is improved via basis updates. However, for numerical reasons
 * dual feasibility must be relaxed from time to time.  Equivalently, primal
 * feasibility will be relaxed to retain numerical stability in the primal
 * Simplex algorithm.
 *
 * Relaxation of (dual or primal) feasibility is achieved by relaxing the bounds
 * of primal or dual variables. However, for each type of Simplex only the
 * corresponding bounds need to be relaxed. Hence, we define only one vector of
 * upper and lower bound for each row and column and initialize it with primal
 * or dual bound, depending on the Simplex type (see \c theURbound, \c
 * theLRbound, \c theUCbound, \c theLCbound).

/**@page EXACT How to use SoPlex as an exact LP solver
 *
 * Since version 1.7, SoPlex implements an \em iterative \em refinement procedure on the level of linear programs, which
 * allows for computing extended-precision solutions beyond the limits of standard floating-point arithmetic.  It may be
 * particularly helpful for numerically troublesome LPs and applications that require solutions within tight feasibility
 * tolerances.  Since version 2.1 this has been extended to compute exact rational solutions. Since version 7.0, SoPlex
 * can also use \em incremental precision boosting \em to compute exact rational solutions. By default, SoPlex uses
 * a combination of an out iterative refinement loop, with precision boosting as a fallback incase of numerical problems.
 *
 * By default, SoPlex functions as a standard floating-point LP solver.  In order to use SoPlex as an exact LP solver,
 * you need to compile SoPlex with GMP support (default, see the \ref INSTALL "INSTALL" file) and change the following
 * parameters from their default value:
 *
 * - <code>real:feastol = 0</code>
 *
 * - <code>real:opttol = 0</code>
 *
 * - <code>int:solvemode = 2</code>
 *
 * - <code>int:syncmode = 1</code>
 *
 * - <code>int:readmode = 1</code> (optional, activates exact parsing of input files)
 *
 * - <code>int:checkmode = 2</code> (optional, activates exact final check of feasibility and optimality at the command
 *   line)
 *
 * See \ref PARS "this page" how to change parameters and the \ref PARSLIST "list of all SoPlex parameters" for their
 * detailed description.  A settings file <code>exact.set</code> for exact solving is provided in the directory
 * <code>settings</code> of the distribution.  On the command line, this can be read with option
 * <code>\-\-loadset=settings/exact.set</code>.
 *
 * If you have questions on particularly this feature you can contact <a href="http://www.zib.de/gleixner/">Ambros
