# Call with "make testcluster"
#
# Runs distributed tests on the cluster via SLURM.
#
# The SLURM "mip" queue consists of 9 nodes (opt210 - opt218). Each node
# provides 2 Intel Xeon X5672 CPUs @ 3.2 GHz each with 4 cores, 12 MB cache and
# 50 GB memory. This gives a total of 9 * 2 * 4 = 72 cores.
#
# The "mip-dbg" queue consists of some cores collected from workstations in our
# Integer Programming group.
#
# In case of time measuring you should use the flag EXCLUSIVE=true to enforce
# that only one process is running on any node you use.
#
# To cancel all your jobs of a testset MyTestSet you can call
# "make cancelcluster TEST=MyTestSet".
#
# To get the result files call "./evalcheck_cluster.sh
# results/check.$TSTNAME.$BINNMAE.$SETNAME.eval in directory check/
# This leads to result files
#  - results/check.$TSTNAME.$BINNMAE.$SETNAME.out
#  - results/check.$TSTNAME.$BINNMAE.$SETNAME.res
#  - results/check.$TSTNAME.$BINNMAE.$SETNAME.err
